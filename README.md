# Mapty-Rework-for-Globe
Having created the Mapty application by Jonas Schmedtmann from his course. I was interested to rework the application to work with a globe. 
I've tried implementing WebGL Earth into the existing project. I've come a long way, but as of now there are still some issues. I hope to rework and debug on a later date. 

I do not claim any of the code as my own. Jonas Schmedtmann has taken me and many others through the process of creating all the Classes/Objects and functions thereof. 
As I was very interested in the project and found there _could_ be a possibility of reworking it to work on a globe, I set a challenge for myself. 
These are my results as of now.
